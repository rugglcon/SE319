Some useful module structures:
* Uses structure
	* the units are also modules, perhaps classes
	* the units are related by the uses relation, a specialized
		form of dependency

* layer structure
	* a layer is an abstract "virtual machine" that provides a 
		cohesive set of services through a managed interface
	* layers are allowed to use other layers in a strictly managed
		fashion
		* in strictly layered systems, a layer is only allowed to use 
			a single other layer
	* this structure allows for portability of systems -- the ability
		to change the underlying computing platform

* class (or generalization) structure
	* the module units in this structure are called classes
	* the relation is inherits from

* data model
	* the data model describes the static information structure
		in terms of data entities and their relationships
		* for example, in a banking system, entities will typically
			include Account, Customer, and Loan
		* Account has several attributes, such as account number
